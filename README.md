## Saving Plans in Cursor

To save a plan for later execution:

1. **Create a plan**: Use Cursor's plan mode to generate a plan
2. **Save the plan**: 
   - Copy the plan content to `.cursorplan` file (template provided)
   - Or use Cursor's built-in save functionality if available
3. **Load later**: Reference the plan file when you're ready to execute

A `.cursorplan` template is included in this workspace.
